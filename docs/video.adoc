== Proxying Session Video

Ggr gives you an ability to view Selenium session videos captured directly from browser screen.

. Video files are expected to be stored on the hub hosts specified in quota files and accessible via the following URL:

    http://hub-host.example.com:4444/video/<real-session-id>.mp4

+
This API for example is supported by http://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest[Selenoid].
. To download video file via Ggr just use the same request but with the session ID returned to test:

     $ curl -o video-file.mp4 http://ggr-host.example.com:4444/video/<test-session-id>

+
NOTE: Notice that session ID for hub host (aka `real-session-id`) and for Ggr (aka `test-session-id`) differ - the latter is longer because it contains information about hub host. Trying to use shorter session ID will not work.
. To delete video file via Ggr just change HTTP method to DELETE:

    $ curl -X DELETE http://ggr-host.example.com:4444/video/<test-session-id>
